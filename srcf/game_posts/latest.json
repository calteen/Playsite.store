    "about": "Tales of the Rays (Old) is an RPG belonging to the popular saga 'Tales of', which for the first time has successfully managed to migrate the experience of its previous console titles to the Android ecosystem. On this occasion, players join Ix and Mileena to resurrect the Old World as they rediscover the glory of past heroes.\r\n\r\nFighting in Tales of the Rays (Old) takes place live, perfectly adapted to tactile control systems. Tapping your screen has you deploying normal attacks onto your enemies, while sliding your finger in different directions lets you use special attack abilities.\r\n\r\nWhen you're not going out on adventures or actively battling during combat you can make a stop to visit your base and manage each aspect of your group of heroes. Little by little you'll also recruit new characters, some of which are old acquaintances from other titles within this franchise. Otherwise you can also customize your hero's appearance to raise his level, teach him new skills, equip him with better weapons, and much more.\r\n\r\nTales of the Rays (Old) is an excellent JRPG with outstanding finishing touches, well defined graphics, and as is usual within the saga, 'Tales of' has impressive animation sequences. Not to mention its great soundtrack and back story full of extensive player missions. In short, we're looking at a PC or console-level title (in terms of quality and playability) that's emerged to much success on Android.\r\n",

  "about": "Flappy Bird is an arcade game where you control a likeable bird that has to fly through many obstacles all made up of pipes.\r\n\r\nThe mechanics are very simple: you have to tap the screen so that the bird flaps its wings, trying to keep a steady rhythm in order to pass through the pipes scattered through its path. It won't be at all easy to do.\r\n\r\nIt will be a challenge to get more than five points (which means flying through five pipes), as it's really difficult to maintain a steady flapping rhythm. In fact, you will have to practice a lot before you start doing well and the game stops being so frustrating.\r\n\r\nEach time you crash and start over, you will notice slight differences that make the game more interesting. You will play in different scenes, at different times (during the day or at night) and with differently colored birds.\r\n\r\nFlappy Bird is an arcade game with very simple mechanics that presents a very difficult challenge. This is precisely why it's so successful, because it sucks you in with just the right amount of difficulty and makes you want to keep trying it one more time.",
